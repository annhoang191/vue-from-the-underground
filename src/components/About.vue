            As an underground girl who spends most of her time grudging real people,
            and tries to live her little life, I can only find comfort in
            fellow underground characters in literature.
            Therefore, I make this place to honor these guys and also to remind myself to have a little courage to keep on living
            <br/>
            <strike>Also because I'm pretentious and want to build some dark academia aesthetic</strike>

          <p>*<strong>Vue From Underground</strong>:
            I build this site with <strong>Vue</strong> (<em>/vjuÀê/</em>) to learn this framework, hence the name!
            It's a <strong>"View From The Underground"</strong>
